== Description ==

= Who is the PageManager Plugin for? =

If your website offers many articles falling into different categories, then PageManager plugin is your best choice to present your content attractively.

So if you are running a local news website,  niche online magazin, cooking blog, online travel magazin or any other content stuffed project you should try out PageManager.

Since page blocks in the PageManager are mainly composed of images and headings, you will get the best results if all posts have a featured image.

PageManager works with the majority of WordPress Themes, but hasn’t adapted to Block-Editor Themes like Twenty Twenty-Two.

The out of the box page block layout can easily be adjusted with Additional CSS in the WordPress Customizer.

If you want to customize the HTML layout, you can add templates to your own theme. Of course, this requires some experience with WordPress theme development.

PageManager is a lightweight solution that developers can set up quickly and easily.

If you don't have the skills, time or just don't feel like learning to code, you can always hire the development team behind the PageManager Plugin to do it.
